* This repos is still a WORK IN PROGRESS


The purpose of this repository is to provide a software program that will allow for the analysis of battery pack data. This anaylsis will sort raw data and provide an output of clean data. This clean data will be found in two differemt folders, sorted data and vis_bus. Eventually the goal is to run a Principle Compnent Analysis (PCA) on the cleaned data in order to find which components produce the largest change.

For any questions, please contact the contributors.

## Use Cases

### User: Industry/ Academic Researcher
   Clean and accessible data
    Clear and concise interpretation of the data with visualization.
    Knowledge on what variables contribute to the lifespan of the battery pack.
    Knowing the process and methodology for how the data is collected, parsed, cleaned, etc. 
#### Component Design: 
   PCA operations to determine the greatest contributing variables.
    Digestible and intuitive data visualization for easy interpretation
    Well documented workflow with markdowns, comments, and good organization. 

### User: King County Metro Maintenance Tech.
  The process of transferring data from the bus to the battery management system is seamless and automatic. 
    Visual indicator of the location and health of each battery pack.  
    Able to predict battery lifecycle to schedule future replacement. 
#### Component Design: 
   Digestible and intuitive data visualization for easy interpretation
    Develop a machine learning model based off given data to predict battery health and lifespan.
