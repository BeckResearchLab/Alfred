* This repos is still a WORK IN PROGRESS


The purpose of this repository is to provide a software program that will allow for the analysis of battery pack data. This anaylsis will sort raw data and provide an output of clean data. This clean data will be found in two differemt folders, sorted data and vis_bus. Eventually the goal is to run a Principle Compnent Analysis (PCA) on the cleaned data in order to find which components produce the largest change.

For any questions, please contact the contributors.
